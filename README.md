# MAL Client OS X
Native MyAnimeList Client for Mac OS X written with RealBasic/Xojo. This project requires Realbasic 2009 R4 or later.

This is a discontinued project and the successor is [MAL Library](https://github.com/Atelier-Shiori/MALLibrary), which is 100x better with a modern UI and code base.
